### Then:

The application was initially created by Siamon Hasan, using:
 * php - http://php.net
 * mysql - https://www.mysql.com
 * bootstrap - http://getbootstrap.com

### Now:

Being in need of a means for keeping a moderate level of organization around some stuff my family's trying to sell on eBay produced the need for me to seek out something like this.

It seems that the original repo was created and then left to stand on its own.
I created this fork in an effort to bend it to my needs while providing the originator of the app his due.

I'm now going to make changes as I see fit without pushing them upstream since that seems to be crapped out.

## After that:

You'll want to start on the "INSTALLING" document.
